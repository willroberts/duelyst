## <a id="code-structure" />Code Structure

An in-depth explanation of the code can be found in the Architecture Documentation above.
It contains some pointers to the specific places in the code used by each service or component.

To help you get acquainted more quickly, here is a list of files and directories commonly used when working on the game:

- `app/` contains code for the frontend / game client
- `config/` contains configuration for backend services
- `docker-compose.yaml` contains our Docker container configuration
- `gulp/` and `gulpfile.babel.js` contain workflow automation, for tasks like building the game code
- `package.json` contains our Node.js dependencies
- `server` contains code for the HTTP API server, the multi-player game server, and single-player game server
- `test` contains unit and integration tests
- `worker` contains code for the worker, which processes asynchronous background jobs

#### Code Style and Linting

For JavaScript code, we use ESLint to enforce code style.
Its configuration can be found in `.eslintrc.json`.
You can run the linter with `yarn lint:js`.
You can automatically format JS code to meet these standards by running `yarn format-js`.

For CoffeeScript code, we use CoffeeLint to enforce code style.
Its configuration can be found in `coffeelint.json`.
You can run the linter with `yarn lint:coffee`.

#### Regarding JavaScript, CoffeeScript, and TypeScript

Most of the code is written in CoffeeScript, which compiles into JavaScript.
We are slowly replacing CoffeeScript with JavaScript (see [Issue #4](https://github.com/open-duelyst/duelyst/issues/4)).

We should also consider moving to TypeScript where possible.
There is a fairly strict `tsconfig.json` in the repo which has been preconfigured for new code.
After writing new TypeScript code, you can run `yarn tsc` to build it using this config.

## <a id="dev-environment" />Setting up a Development Environment

#### Installing System Dependencies

Before you get started, you'll need [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Node.js + NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
These will enable you to run the code in containers, and to interact with the JavaScript build process.

Once you have `npm`, you can use it to install Yarn (the package manager we use):

```bash
npm install -g yarn  # You can use `sudo` on Mac or Linux if this gives you a permissions error.
```

#### Installing Node.js Dependencies

Once you have Yarn installed, you can install the dependencies for the game:

```bash
yarn tsc:chroma-js  # Compile TypeScript dependencies.
yarn install --dev  # Install remaining Node.js dependencies.
```

#### Setting up Firebase

In order to successfully run the game, you will need a [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/).
Fortunately, Google provides a free version of this service called the ["Spark Pricing Plan"](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/billing/firebase-pricing-plans).

Once you have created a Firebase account and a Realtime Database, take note of your Realtime Database's URL, as you'll need it when building the code.
You will also want to configure the Security Rules for your database. You can copy these from [rules.json](rules.json) in the repo.

#### Building the Code

Now that dependencies are installed, you can build the game code and its assets! This step will take a few minutes.

On Mac or Linux:
```bash
FIREBASE_URL=<YOUR_FIREBASE_URL> yarn build
```

On Windows:
```powershell
$env:FIREBASE_URL = '<YOUR_FIREBASE_URL>'
yarn build
```

Including the Firebase URL is important, since it enables the game client to communicate with the servers.
After the initial build, you can save time with `yarn build:app` (code only; no assets) or `yarn build:web` (frontend HTML/CSS/JS only).

## <a id="starting-the-game" />Starting the Game Locally

#### Additional Firebase Configuration

Now that you have a development environment set up, there's a bit more Firebase configuration to do.
From your Firebase project settings page, click the "Service Accounts" tab.

First, click "Database Secrets" and create a new legacy token.
Create a `.env` file in the repo root with the following contents:

```bash
FIREBASE_URL=<YOUR_FIREBASE_URL>
FIREBASE_LEGACY_TOKEN=<YOUR_FIREBASE_LEGACY_TOKEN>
```

Next, still on the Firebase "Service Accounts" page, click on the Service Accounts popout to open Google Cloud.
Create a new service account with the ability to read from and write to Firebase.
You can achieve this by using the "Firebase Realtime Database Admin" role, but you may want to restrict this later.

On the Google "Service Accounts" page, clicking "Manage Keys" next to the newly-created service account will let you create a new JSON key.
Do this, and save it as `serviceAccountKey.json` in the repo root.

Note: Both `.env` and `serviceAccountKey.json` are ignored by Git for this repo, so these secrets can't be accidentally committed.

#### Starting with Docker

Now that the game has been built and Firebase has been configured, you can start the servers locally and play a game.
We use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to manage containers for the game servers, Redis cache, and Postgres database.

As a final step before starting the game servers, the Postgres database must be initialized.
To do this, run `docker compose up migrate`.

Now you can run `docker compose up` to start the game servers and their dependencies.

Once you see `Duelyst 'development' started on port 3000` in the logs, the server is ready!
Open http://localhost:3000/ in a browser to load the game client, create a user, and play a practice game.

## <a id="frontend-changes" />Making App (Frontend) Changes

Now that you have the full development environment set up, you can try making changes to the game client.
To do this, edit any code, cards, or resources desired in the `app/` directory.

When finished, build the game once more:
```
FIREBASE_URL=<YOUR_FIREBASE_URL> yarn build
```

You can now run `docker compose up` again and load the client to test your changes.

## <a id="backend-changes" />Making Server/Worker (Backend) Changes

When working on the Server or Worker code, you don't need to rebuild the game.
Instead, simply run `docker compose up` again, and load the game client to test your changes.

Don't forget to run unit tests with `yarn test:unit`, and integration tests with `yarn test:integration`.
If you notice a failing test for code you haven't changed, please file a new `bug` issue.

## <a id="pull-requests" />Opening Pull Requests

Once you have a contribution ready, you can open a pull request to get it reviewed by the maintainers.

First, fork OpenDuelyst on Github, and push your branch to the fork.
Then, when signed into Github, you'll be prompted to open a pull request when viewing the OpenDuelyst repo.

If the contribution solves an open issue, you can automatically close that issue when the PR is merged.
To do this, include the text "Closes #1234" in the PR description (to automatically close issue #1234).

When you open a pull request, some tasks will automatically start in our Continuous Integration (CI) environment to lint and test the code.
We use [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI, so you can see the status and results of these tasks right in the pull request itself.

Once the PR has been reviewed and accepted, it will be merged into the `main` branch.
At this point, you are now an OpenDuelyst developer. Congratulations!

## <a id="get-help" />Where to Get Help

At the moment, you can get help with OpenDuelyst by opening an issue.
Since this is a volunteer project, it may take a few days for someone to look at your issue.

Stay tuned for more communication options in the future.
